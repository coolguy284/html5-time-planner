small tasks:
add priority for which event color / category takes precedence in stats view below table
try black border around events in table view
auto update schedule table every minute if on latest week (requires recalculating parsedweeks, somehow do this efficiently)
switch between weekly and much bigger than weekly view (configurable, probably starting at present day, going back in groups of 30 or more); also have standard monthly view, and yearly view
duplicate event backwards should edit previously duplicated event if there is one
remove unnecessary data page button ids
give buttons on hover and on selected shading

big concepts:
change events list to be cleaner
  all events in one array along with priority or smth
  error in testing phase if all events are not given a group
move to a json based v2 of the format
  it will have 2 versions of the same format, a json format called format 2, and a binary format 2b that also has compression (either deflate or ppmd) and stuff
    binary format
      time can be stored as i64 milliseconds since epoch
      boolean flags can all go in one byte
  backtemporal
    add flag to track if event array is "clean" or if it might have backtemporal events
      might not be needed if duplicate event backwards always checks anyway
      if purges are run then backtemporal check not needed, so this would set the clean flag after the purges
  store events list in the saved data
    also store some convenience things like which tab currently on, scrolling state for all tabs, etc.
  should store version of program (or maybe program hash) and if it changed, auto take backup of the thing in localstorage, saved to another localstorage entry like _backup_xx (x going from 1 upwards) (do this after confirmation prompt in case user doesnt feel like it)
  make upgrade routine (that probably saves a backup or at least asks to)
make page / phase screens for the different events that would be in different phases of life

low tier:
when a new event is added and data_div is scrolled to the bottom, scroll it to the new bottom; same goes for checking and unchecking 'collapse event groups'
allow more than 1 event in some cases
add hard reset button with confirmation
add ability to annotate previous or second previous entry
darken button that is active, like current tab, current event
color button that cannot be clicked a disabled color (for week picker)
fix coloring of tables & charts page
make percentage stats box not unicode chars and actual div instead
fix mobile seperation of stats percentage entries being greater than 0
merge duplicate groups when converting many events to groups

probably not needed:
button for ___EVENT_DATA___
