collapse duplicate events should not collapse same event name but different annotation
try black border around events in table view
auto update schedule table every minute if on latest week (requires recalculating parsedweeks, somehow do this efficiently)
switch between weekly and much bigger than weekly view (configurable, probably starting at present day, going back in groups of 30 or more); also have standard monthly view, and yearly view
duplicate event backwards should edit previously duplicated event if there is one
remove unnecessary data page button ids
give buttons on hover and on selected shading
toggles for___EVENT_DATA___, ___EVENT_DATA___, ___EVENT_DATA___

low tier:
when a new event is added and data_div is scrolled to the bottom, scroll it to the new bottom; same goes for checking and unchecking 'collapse event groups'
allow more than 1 event in some cases
add hard reset button with confirmation
add ability to annotate previous or second previous entry
darken button that is active, like current tab, current event
color button that cannot be clicked a disabled color (for week picker)
fix coloring of tables & charts page
make percentage stats box not unicode chars and actual div instead
fix mobile seperation of stats percentage entries being greater than 0

probably not needed:
button for ___EVENT_DATA___
button for ___EVENT_DATA___
