small tasks:
fix collapse duplicates collapsing duplicates name but different annotation

rawdata textarea should have min size
check extras div stuff for proper overflow, should be per div
all ui buttons should not be able to be rerun while they are running
  add another thing to critical code to keep track of this probably in a named object and then rename the file
add another part to v2 for the categorized buttons list
utf8 encode and decode
  option 1
    make utf8 encode and decode funcs that go through every character in a string and will call encodeuricomponent if charcode over 127
    output is u8array ofc
    then figure out some complex thing for utf8 decode
    actually shouldn't be complex, go through bytes and if one is above 127 then based on how above it is, the next 2 3 or 4 chars will be one utf8 char (but possibly one or 2 utf16 chars)
  or just manually do utf8 shouldn't be too hard, but store lone surrogates without erroring
    as though they are not surrogates

add extras progress bar, and add refresh button
  refreshing should show a textual indicator of when refreshing is occurring and when it is finished, also ignore button presses while refreshing is occurring
give buttons / labels shading for when they are selected (as in event or tab)
only update tab when it is clicked on (performance or smth idk)
add a move events backward button
add bg color of black to very bright text in percent stats div
2 tier collapse, radio buttons, either to main event or to category
auto update schedule table every minute if on latest week (requires recalculating parsedweeks, somehow do this efficiently)
switch between weekly and much bigger than weekly view (configurable, probably starting at present day, going back in groups of 30 or more); also have standard monthly view, and yearly view
duplicate event backwards should edit previously duplicated event if there is one
bulk 01 (pseudo-rawdataview):
  when you click on a tab the data is brought up to speed
  edit tab that has pseudo rawdataview where entries on newlines and human readable, also includes preconfig at top; when saving if format is wrong error message will be printed incl line num (add line nums to view for human readability, remove them in memory when parsing but add back to textarea if missing if error so error can be found)
  once storing binary data the raw data view will show hex with newline every x bytes
  raw data should also show string length and estimated storage use
  extras tab with pseudo webpage style design (clickable buttons and a return to main page thing)
    also contain an extras file viewer thing to edit arbitrary binary data files not just the one actively being used in localstorage, will have 2 tabs for pseudorawdataview and actual data view (prob in hex cause binary, newlines at every x bytes); and obv buttons to load file and save to file
    button somewhere to export data, maybe on the extras page
    prob add settings page button to extras page
    make the progress bar graph for storage use on extras page
bulk 02 (format v2):
  type up format specifiers for each version of the format and put them in a folder
  start with v1, and do it nicely with examples for each field n stuff
  also explain how the raw data is converted to an in memory representation
  put events and categories in v2
  binary format:
    binary format should probably have some sort of minutes timezone flag but normally store timezone as hourly int offset (so one byte by default but sometimes 2)
      or zero bytes for timezone (it will have same value as previous entry)
    annotation presence is bool flag, but the flag is 3 bits long or smth because also has a length param could be 1 or 2 or 3 bytes length, at start of annotation
    timestamp can probably be 12 bytes unsigned with flag for long version of 16 bytes unsigned; units of millis since epoch which is when program was first released to make the number smaller
      use that now removed code that placed initial epoch for tables on 2023-09 smth, as the epoch
    those will actually be formats 1 and 2 of the timestamp, format 3 will be a 3 byte delta in ms able to represent 0-16,777.215 seconds after previous event, and format 4 will be 4 byte delta in ms able to represent 0-4,294,967.295 seconds after previous event (so virtually 100% of events will have very compact timestamp now)
    maybe if 128th place bit is high in flags byte it is a "blitz mode" entry that is flag byte, 3 or 4 byte offset, 1 byte event type
      (now that i type this, entries should be that by default if they qualify anyway)
    try gzipping or lzmaing whole thing
    first character of binary value will be the 0 or 1 flag, so forget about making 2 seperate keys
    binary to utf-16 conversion functions
    have an index for most common annotations, probably for now manually added like event categories
  
  generic format accesser object, it even handles initial loading
    and will not auto upgrade the stored format, it will just keep accessing the old format
    but there will be a method to update the underlying format
    also maybe have some sort of way of synchronously saving backup data while an asynchronous save finishes, then deleting the backup data
  
  for all asynchronous but critical code, set a flag that beforeunload will check for (maybe have an array so new function calls can independently turn on and then turn off the flag, turning off is deleting the array element, and shrinking size of array if at end)
bulk 03:
  cache sanity check value as well
    if localstorage is insane then the planner will not function so there needs to be a clean way to show that, most likely just have a top level div switcheroo going on
    and code execution should stop immediately at top of page if so
    add button to recalculate max space on that extras page, it deletes the sanity and max size caches and recalculates, if sanity is now false then do the div swap and its a big rip
    store experimentally derived max size in localstorage, use for percentage number and bar at top of extras page
    
    move all the localstorage funcs to library file at root folder
    
    possibly not doing:
      make storage tests synchronous cause why not, page needs the results to know whether to operate anyway
        since cached it doesn't even matter

big concepts:
change events list to be cleaner
  all events in one array along with priority or smth
  error in testing phase if all events are not given a group
move to a json based v2 of the format
  it will have 2 versions of the same format, a json format called format 2, and a binary format 2b that also has compression (either deflate or ppmd) and stuff
    binary format
      time can be stored as i64 milliseconds since epoch
      boolean flags can all go in one byte
  backtemporal
    add flag to track if event array is "clean" or if it might have backtemporal events
      might not be needed if duplicate event backwards always checks anyway
      if purges are run then backtemporal check not needed, so this would set the clean flag after the purges
  store events list in the saved data
    also store some convenience things like which tab currently on, scrolling state for all tabs, etc.
  should store version of program (or maybe program hash) and if it changed, auto take backup of the thing in localstorage, saved to another localstorage entry like _backup_xx (x going from 1 upwards) (do this after confirmation prompt in case user doesnt feel like it)
  make upgrade routine (that probably saves a backup or at least asks to)
make page / phase screens for the different events that would be in different phases of life
stats and tables for day, week, month, year, past 30 days (and every 30 days before that), past 90 days, all time
do extra tall bar for fall back, and extra short for spring forward
ghostly blocks for future events, and maybe have stats about how close correlation is between future events that have now passed and present events (so you can feel bad about yourself (i joke i hope))
  this obviously implies adding some way to add future events, probably a weekly schedule thing that can be revised live, but stores old revisions in the main event history once the event has passed (with a special flag of course)
    or maybe store it as a seperate array where, as long as events list is not modified, new events are not added for efficiency, so maybe just keep track of old versions of planned events list
  maybe also daily and monthly planning at the same time (daily for sleep for example) or yearly or one time planning (for break schedules) and ability to switch between 2 or more different schedules, like switching to break schedule on one time scheduled thanksgiving and other breaks

low tier:
fix extreme digits of precision for table div heights and repeating linear gradient sections
fix table's stripe bars being raster images basically (due to repeating-linear-gradient), convert them to svgs instead either with css or manually making an svg element using javascript
when a new event is added and data_div is scrolled to the bottom, scroll it to the new bottom; same goes for checking and unchecking 'collapse event groups'
allow more than 1 event in some cases
add hard reset button with confirmation
add ability to annotate previous or second previous entry
darken button that is active, like current tab, current event
color button that cannot be clicked a disabled color (for week picker)
fix coloring of tables & charts page
make percentage stats box not unicode chars and actual div instead
fix mobile seperation of stats percentage entries being greater than 0
merge duplicate groups when converting many events to groups
duplicate evt backwards should check if duplicate will go before the previous event's time, prompt to delete previous event if so
add check integrity of data button
  checks for backtemporal events, and others stuff
trim events that last a few seconds, replace with next event, at least do this for short periods of decreasing events, then nothing, then increasing events
do some thinking to make localstorage test binary search a mathematically perfect binary search and not double check powers of 2 or something

probably not doing:
try black border around events in table view
